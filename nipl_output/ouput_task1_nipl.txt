MACHINE LEARNING ML IS THE STUDY OF COMPUTER ALGORITHMS THAT CAN IMPROVE AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH EXPERIENCE AND BY THE USE OF DATA IT IS SEEN AS A PART OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS BUILD A MODEL BASED ON SAMPLE DATA KNOWN AS TRAINING DATA IN ORDER TO MAKE PREDICTIONS OR DECISIONS WITHOUT BEING EXPLICITLY PROGRAMMED TO DO SO MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS ARE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS SUCH AS IN MEDICINE EMAIL FILTERING SPEECH RECOGNITION AND COMPUTER VISION WHERE IT IS DIFFICULT OR UNFEASIBLE TO DEVELOP CONVENTIONAL ALGORITHMS TO PERFORM THE NEEDED TASKSA SUBSET OF MACHINE LEARNING IS CLOSELY RELATED TO COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS WHICH FOCUSES ON MAKING PREDICTIONS USING COMPUTERS BUT NOT ALL MACHINE LEARNING IS STATISTICAL LEARNING THE STUDY OF

ASSIGNED TO COMPUTERS IT IS POSSIBLE TO PROGRAM ALGORITHMS TELLING THE MACHINE HOW TO EXECUTE ALL STEPS REQUIRED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AT HAND ON THE COMPUTERS PART NO LEARNING IS NEEDED FOR MORE ADVANCED TASKS IT CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR A HUMAN TO MANUALLY CREATE THE NEEDED ALGORITHMS IN PRACTICE IT CAN TURN OUT TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE TO HELP THE MACHINE DEVELOP ITS OWN ALGORITHM RATHER THAN HAVING HUMAN PROGRAMMERS SPECIFY EVERY NEEDED STEPTHE DISCIPLINE OF MACHINE LEARNING EMPLOYS VARIOUS APPROACHES TO TEACH COMPUTERS TO ACCOMPLISH TASKS WHERE NO FULLY SATISFACTORY ALGORITHM IS AVAILABLE IN CASES WHERE VAST NUMBERS OF POTENTIAL ANSWERS EXIST ONE APPROACH IS TO LABEL SOME OF THE CORRECT ANSWERS AS VALID THIS CAN THEN BE USED AS TRAINING DATA FOR THE COMPUTER TO IMPROVE THE ALGORITHMS IT USES TO DETERMINE CORRECT ANSWERS FOR EXAMPLE TO TRAIN A SYSTEM FOR THE TASK OF DIGITAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION THE MNIST DATASET OF HANDWRITTEN DIGITS HAS OFTEN BEEN USEDHISTORY AND RELATIONSHIPS TO OTHER FIELDSSEE ALSO TIMELINE OF MACHINE LEARNINGTHE TERM MACHINE LEARNING WAS COINED IN  BY ARTHUR SAMUEL AN AMERICAN IBMER AND PIONEER IN THE FIELD OF COMPUTER GAMING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ALSO THE SYNONYM SELFTEACHING COMPUTERS WAS USED IN THIS TIME PERIOD A REPRESENTATIVE BOOK OF THE MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH DURING THE S WAS THE NILSSONS BOOK ON LEARNING MACHINES DEALING MOSTLY WITH MACHINE LEARNING FOR PATTERN CLASSIFICATION INTEREST RELATED TO PATTERN RECOGNITION CONTINUED INTO THE S AS DESCRIBED BY DUDA AND HART IN  IN  A REPORT WAS GIVEN ON USING TEACHING STRATEGIES SO THAT A NEURAL NETWORK LEARNS TO RECOGNIZE  CHARACTERS  LETTERS  DIGITS AND  SPECIAL SYMBOLS FROM A COMPUTER TERMINALTOM M MITCHELL PROVIDED A WIDELY QUOTED MORE FORMAL DEFINITION OF THE ALGORITHMS STUDIED IN THE MACHINE LEARNING FIELD A COMPUTER PROGRAM IS SAID TO LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE E WITH RESPECT TO SOME CLASS OF TASKS T AND PERFORMANCE MEASURE P IF ITS PERFORMANCE AT TASKS IN T AS MEASURED BY P IMPROVES WITH EXPERIENCE E THIS DEFINITION OF THE TASKS IN WHICH MACHINE LEARNING IS CONCERNED OFFERS A FUNDAMENTALLY OPERATIONAL DEFINITION RATHER THAN DEFINING THE FIELD IN COGNITIVE TERMS THIS FOLLOWS ALAN TURINGS PROPOSAL IN HIS PAPER COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE IN WHICH THE QUESTION CAN MACHINES THINK IS REPLACED WITH THE QUESTION CAN MACHINES DO WHAT WE AS THINKING ENTITIES CAN DOMODERN DAY MACHINE LEARNING HAS TWO OBJECTIVES ONE IS TO CLASSIFY DATA BASED ON MODELS WHICH HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THE OTHER PURPOSE IS TO MAKE PREDICTIONS FOR FUTURE OUTCOMES BASED ON THESE MODELS A HYPOTHETICAL ALGORITHM SPECIFIC TO CLASSIFYING DATA MAY USE COMPUTER VISION OF MOLES COUPLED WITH SUPERVISED LEARNING IN ORDER TO TRAIN IT TO CLASSIFY THE CANCEROUS MOLES A

PART OF AI AS SUBFIELD OF MACHINE LEARNINGAS A SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOR MACHINE LEARNING GREW OUT OF THE QUEST FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF AI AS AN ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE SOME RESEARCHERS WERE INTERESTED IN HAVING MACHINES LEARN FROM DATA THEY ATTEMPTED TO APPROACH THE PROBLEM WITH VARIOUS SYMBOLIC METHODS AS WELL AS WHAT WAS THEN TERMED NEURAL NETWORKS THESE WERE MOSTLY PERCEPTRONS AND OTHER MODELS THAT WERE LATER FOUND TO BE REINVENTIONS OF THE GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS OF STATISTICS PROBABILISTIC REASONING WAS ALSO EMPLOYED ESPECIALLY IN AUTOMATED MEDICAL DIAGNOSISHOWEVER AN INCREASING EMPHASIS ON THE LOGICAL KNOWLEDGEBASED APPROACH CAUSED A RIFT BETWEEN AI AND MACHINE LEARNING PROBABILISTIC SYSTEMS WERE PLAGUED BY THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF DATA ACQUISITION AND REPRESENTATION BY  EXPERT SYSTEMS HAD COME TO DOMINATE AI AND STATISTICS WAS OUT OF FAVOR WORK ON SYMBOLICKNOWLEDGEBASED LEARNING DID CONTINUE WITHIN AI LEADING TO INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROGRAMMING BUT THE MORE STATISTICAL LINE OF RESEARCH WAS NOW OUTSIDE THE FIELD OF AI PROPER IN PATTERN RECOGNITION AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL NEURAL NETWORKS RESEARCH HAD BEEN ABANDONED BY AI AND COMPUTER SCIENCE AROUND THE SAME TIME THIS LINE TOO WAS CONTINUED OUTSIDE THE AICS FIELD AS CONNECTIONISM BY RESEARCHERS FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES INCLUDING HOPFIELD RUMELHART AND HINTON THEIR MAIN SUCCESS CAME IN THE MIDS WITH THE REINVENTION OF BACKPROPAGATIONMACHINE LEARNING ML REORGANIZED AS A SEPARATE FIELD STARTED TO FLOURISH IN THE S THE FIELD CHANGED ITS GOAL FROM ACHIEVING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO TACKLING SOLVABLE PROBLEMS OF A PRACTICAL NATURE IT SHIFTED FOCUS AWAY FROM THE SYMBOLIC APPROACHES IT HAD INHERITED FROM AI AND TOWARD METHODS AND MODELS BORROWED FROM STATISTICS FUZZY LOGIC AND PROBABILITY THEORYTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ML AND AI IS FREQUENTLY MISUNDERSTOOD ML LEARNS AND PREDICTS BASED ON PASSIVE OBSERVATIONS WHEREAS AI IMPLIES AN AGENT INTERACTING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT TO LEARN AND TAKE ACTIONS THAT MAXIMIZE ITS CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVING ITS GOALSAS OF  MANY SOURCES CONTINUE TO ASSERT THAT ML REMAINS A SUBFIELD OF AI OTHERS HAVE THE VIEW THAT NOT ALL ML IS PART OF AI BUT ONLY AN INTELLIGENT SUBSET OF ML SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AIDATA MININGMACHINE LEARNING AND DATA MINING OFTEN EMPLOY THE SAME METHODS AND OVERLAP SIGNIFICANTLY BUT WHILE MACHINE LEARNING FOCUSES ON PREDICTION BASED ON KNOWN PROPERTIES LEARNED FROM THE TRAINING DATA DATA MINING FOCUSES ON THE DISCOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN PROPERTIES IN THE DATA THIS IS THE ANALYSIS STEP OF KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DATABASES DATA MINING USES MANY MACHINE LEARNING METHODS BUT WITH DIFFERENT GOALS ON THE OTHER HAND MACHINE LEARNING ALSO EMPLOYS DATA MINING METHODS AS UNSUPERVISED LEARNING OR AS A PREPROCESSING STEP TO IMPROVE LEARNER ACCURACY MUCH OF THE CONFUSION BETWEEN THESE TWO RESEARCH COMMUNITIES WHICH DO OFTEN HAVE SEPARATE CONFERENCES AND SEPARATE JOURNALS ECML PKDD BEING A MAJOR EXCEPTION COMES FROM THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS THEY WORK WITH IN MACHINE LEARNING PERFORMANCE IS USUALLY EVALUATED WITH RESPECT TO THE ABILITY TO REPRODUCE KNOWN KNOWLEDGE WHILE IN KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING KDD THE KEY TASK IS THE DISCOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN KNOWLEDGE EVALUATED WITH RESPECT TO KNOWN KNOWLEDGE AN UNINFORMED UNSUPERVISED METHOD WILL EASILY BE OUTPERFORMED BY OTHER SUPERVISED METHODS WHILE IN A TYPICAL KDD TASK SUPERVISED METHODS CANNOT BE USED DUE TO THE UNAVAILABILITY OF TRAINING DATAOPTIMIZATIONMACHINE LEARNING ALSO HAS INTIMATE TIES TO OPTIMIZATION MANY LEARNING PROBLEMS ARE FORMULATED AS MINIMIZATION OF SOME LOSS FUNCTION ON A TRAINING SET OF EXAMPLES LOSS FUNCTIONS EXPRESS THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE PREDICTIONS OF THE MODEL BEING TRAINED AND THE ACTUAL PROBLEM INSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE IN CLASSIFICATION ONE WANTS TO ASSIGN A LABEL TO INSTANCES AND MODELS ARE TRAINED TO CORRECTLY PREDICT THE PREASSIGNED LABELS OF A SET OF EXAMPLESGENERALIZATIONTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPTIMIZATION AND MACHINE LEARNING ARISES FROM THE GOAL OF GENERALIZATION WHILE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS CAN MINIMIZE THE LOSS ON A TRAINING SET MACHINE LEARNING IS CONCERNED WITH MINIMIZING THE LOSS ON UNSEEN SAMPLES CHARACTERIZING THE GENERALIZATION OF VARIOUS LEARNING ALGORITHMS IS AN ACTIVE TOPIC OF CURRENT RESEARCH ESPECIALLY FOR DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMSSTATISTICSMACHINE LEARNING AND STATISTICS ARE CLOSELY RELATED FIELDS IN TERMS OF METHODS BUT DISTINCT IN THEIR PRINCIPAL GOAL STATISTICS DRAWS POPULATION INFERENCES FROM A SAMPLE WHILE MACHINE LEARNING FINDS GENERALIZABLE PREDICTIVE PATTERNS ACCORDING TO MICHAEL I JORDAN THE IDEAS OF MACHINE LEARNING FROM METHODOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES TO THEORETICAL TOOLS HAVE HAD A LONG PREHISTORY IN STATISTICS HE ALSO SUGGESTED THE TERM DATA SCIENCE AS A PLACEHOLDER TO CALL THE OVERALL FIELDLEO BREIMAN DISTINGUISHED TWO STATISTICAL MODELING PARADIGMS DATA MODEL AND ALGORITHMIC MODEL WHEREIN ALGORITHMIC MODEL MEANS MORE OR LESS THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS LIKE RANDOM FORESTSOME STATISTICIANS HAVE ADOPTED METHODS FROM MACHINE LEARNING LEADING TO A COMBINED FIELD THAT THEY CALL STATISTICAL LEARNINGTHEORYMAIN ARTICLES COMPUTATIONAL LEARNING THEORY AND STATISTICAL LEARNING THEORYA CORE OBJECTIVE OF A LEARNER IS TO GENERALIZE FROM ITS EXPERIENCE GENERALIZATION IN THIS CONTEXT IS THE ABILITY OF A LEARNING MACHINE TO PERFORM ACCURATELY ON NEW UNSEEN EXAMPLESTASKS AFTER HAVING EXPERIENCED A LEARNING DATA SET THE TRAINING EXAMPLES COME FROM SOME GENERALLY UNKNOWN PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION CONSIDERED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SPACE OF OCCURRENCES AND THE LEARNER HAS TO BUILD A GENERAL MODEL ABOUT THIS SPACE THAT ENABLES IT TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE PREDICTIONS IN NEW CASESTHE COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND THEIR PERFORMANCE IS A BRANCH OF THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE KNOWN AS COMPUTATIONAL LEARNING THEORY BECAUSE TRAINING SETS ARE FINITE AND THE FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN LEARNING THEORY USUALLY DOES NOT YIELD GUARANTEES OF THE PERFORMANCE OF ALGORITHMS INSTEAD PROBABILISTIC BOUNDS ON THE PERFORMANCE ARE QUITE COMMON THE BIASVARIANCE DECOMPOSITION IS ONE WAY TO QUANTIFY GENERALIZATION ERRORFOR THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF GENERALIZATION THE COMPLEXITY OF THE HYPOTHESIS SHOULD MATCH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FUNCTION UNDERLYING THE DATA IF THE HYPOTHESIS IS LESS COMPLEX THAN THE FUNCTION THEN THE MODEL HAS UNDER FITTED THE DATA IF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE MODEL IS INCREASED IN RESPONSE THEN THE TRAINING ERROR DECREASES BUT IF THE HYPOTHESIS IS TOO COMPLEX THEN THE MODEL IS SUBJECT TO OVERFITTING AND GENERALIZATION WILL BE POORERIN ADDITION TO PERFORMANCE BOUNDS LEARNING THEORISTS STUDY THE TIME COMPLEXITY AND FEASIBILITY OF LEARNING IN COMPUTATIONAL LEARNING THEORY A COMPUTATION IS CONSIDERED FEASIBLE IF IT CAN BE DONE IN POLYNOMIAL TIME THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF TIME COMPLEXITY RESULTS POSITIVE RESULTS SHOW THAT A CERTAIN CLASS OF FUNCTIONS CAN BE LEARNED IN POLYNOMIAL TIME NEGATIVE RESULTS SHOW THAT CERTAIN CLASSES CANNOT BE LEARNED IN POLYNOMIAL TIMEAPPROACHESMACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES ARE TRADITIONALLY DIVIDED INTO THREE

OUTPUTS THE DATA IS KNOWN AS TRAINING DATA AND CONSISTS OF A SET OF TRAINING EXAMPLES EACH TRAINING EXAMPLE HAS ONE OR MORE INPUTS AND THE DESIRED OUTPUT ALSO KNOWN AS A SUPERVISORY SIGNAL IN THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL EACH TRAINING EXAMPLE IS REPRESENTED BY AN ARRAY OR VECTOR SOMETIMES CALLED A FEATURE VECTOR AND THE TRAINING DATA IS REPRESENTED BY A MATRIX THROUGH ITERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF AN OBJECTIVE FUNCTION SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS LEARN A FUNCTION THAT CAN BE USED TO PREDICT THE OUTPUT ASSOCIATED WITH NEW INPUTS AN OPTIMAL FUNCTION WILL ALLOW THE ALGORITHM TO CORRECTLY DETERMINE

ALGORITHMS IDENTIFY COMMONALITIES IN THE DATA AND REACT BASED ON THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF SUCH COMMONALITIES IN EACH NEW PIECE OF DATA A CENTRAL APPLICATION OF UNSUPERVISED LEARNING IS IN THE FIELD OF DENSITY ESTIMATION IN STATISTICS SUCH AS FINDING THE PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION THOUGH UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ENCOMPASSES OTHER DOMAINS INVOLVING SUMMARIZING AND EXPLAINING DATA FEATURESCLUSTER ANALYSIS IS THE ASSIGNMENT OF A SET OF OBSERVATIONS INTO SUBSETS CALLED CLUSTERS SO THAT OBSERVATIONS WITHIN THE SAME CLUSTER ARE SIMILAR ACCORDING TO ONE OR MORE PREDESIGNATED CRITERIA WHILE OBSERVATIONS DRAWN FROM DIFFERENT CLUSTERS ARE DISSIMILAR DIFFERENT CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES MAKE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE DATA OFTEN DEFINED BY SOME SIMILARITY METRIC AND EVALUATED

MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TRAINED MODELS DERIVED FROM BIASED OR NONEVALUATED DATA CAN RESULT IN SKEWED OR UNDESIRED PREDICTIONS BIAS MODELS MAY RESULT IN DETRIMENTAL OUTCOMES THEREBY FURTHERING THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO SOCIETY OR OBJECTIVES ALGORITHMIC BIAS IS A POTENTIAL RESULT FROM DATA NOT FULLY PREPARED FOR TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING ETHICS IS BECOMING A FIELD OF STUDY AND NOTABLY BE INTEGRATED WITHIN MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEERING TEAMSFEDERATED LEARNINGMAIN ARTICLE FEDERATED LEARNINGFEDERATED LEARNING IS AN ADAPTED FORM OF DISTRIBUTED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS THAT DECENTRALIZES THE TRAINING PROCESS ALLOWING FOR USERS PRIVACY TO BE MAINTAINED BY NOT NEEDING TO SEND THEIR DATA TO A CENTRALIZED SERVER THIS ALSO INCREASES EFFICIENCY BY DECENTRALIZING THE TRAINING PROCESS TO MANY DEVICES FOR EXAMPLE GBOARD USES FEDERATED MACHINE LEARNING TO TRAIN SEARCH QUERY PREDICTION MODELS ON USERS MOBILE PHONES WITHOUT HAVING TO SEND INDIVIDUAL
